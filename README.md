A discord bot that gets stock information


A very basic discord stock bot that used basic user input to display stock information.

$stock [ticker] will display the end of the closing price for the ticker( if the market is still open, it will show yesterdays closing price)
$gainers will display the top 5 tickers with the largest percentage gain
$losers will display the top 5 tickers with the largest percentage loss
$info [ticker] will display information about the stock and financial ratios that might be relevant.

Will add more functionality as time passes.
